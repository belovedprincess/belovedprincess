<p align="center">　 　. ۫ 　　.  ➜　Hello darlings, I am Aurélie <3 I go by she/her, 15歳, and abrosexual 𐔌՞. .՞𐦯 I adore the rococo/victorian era fashion, lolita style, and being a princess! I often rest at docks to watch the commonfolk trot around, so if you happen to see me, come and say hello! I am very friendly, but I am extremely shy and quiet. Opening up to people is hard for me to do, as it will take maybe a month or so to warm up, please be patient! I am trying my best ‪♡ I have autism with heavy sensory issues while having ADHD, tonetags will be needed when talking to me. ૮ ․ ․ ྀིა　　　꣑ৎ
